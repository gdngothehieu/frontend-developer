# Weather-Journal App Project

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI in a Weather Journal application.

## Install

Run the command 'npm install' to install required dependencies (npm install express, npm install body-parser).

## Start

The project can be run by running the command "node server.js" in the root directory and then opening http://localhost:8000/ in browser.
## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
